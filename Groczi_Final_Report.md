This modular organization promotes code reusability and maintainability.

### Optimization Algorithms

**Single-Store Optimization:**
- Scoring function: `score = λ × travel_cost + item_cost`
- Lambda (λ) values: 0.1 (cost priority), 1.0 (balanced), 10.0 (distance priority)
- Store ranking based on combined score
- Missing item handling with user notification

**Multi-Store Optimization:**
- Dynamic programming approach for optimal store-item assignment
- Travel cost calculation including return to origin
- Maximum store and distance constraints
- Solution ranking by total cost (items + travel)

### Testing Strategy

**Component Testing:**
- Unit tests for individual components using Jest and React Native Testing Library
- Snapshot testing for UI consistency
- Integration tests for component interactions

**Store Testing:**
- Action testing with mock API responses
- State consistency validation
