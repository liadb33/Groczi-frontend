## Abstract

Groczi is an intelligent grocery optimization system designed to solve the complex problem of multi-store shopping optimization for consumers. The system addresses the real-world challenge of finding the most cost-effective combination of stores to purchase grocery items, considering both item prices and travel costs. 

The backend system employs advanced algorithmic approaches including dynamic programming for multi-store optimization, machine learning for data enhancement via OpenAI integration, and real-time web scraping for price data collection. The architecture is built on Node.js with TypeScript, MySQL database with Prisma ORM, and includes sophisticated data processing pipelines.

Key achievements include the implementation of a dynamic programming algorithm for optimal multi-store route planning, real-time price tracking across multiple grocery chains, and an AI-powered data normalization system. The system successfully processes large datasets from multiple Israeli grocery chains and provides sub-second optimization results for complex shopping scenarios.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Motivation

In modern society, grocery shopping represents a significant time and financial burden for households. Consumers often face the dilemma of choosing between convenience (shopping at a single store) and cost optimization (visiting multiple stores for the best prices). The problem becomes exponentially complex when considering factors such as:

- Price variations across different stores and chains
- Travel costs and time between locations
- Product availability at different stores
- Dynamic pricing and promotional offers

This complexity makes manual optimization impractical for consumers, creating a clear need for an intelligent system that can automate the decision-making process.

### 1.2 Problem Statement

The core problem addressed by Groczi is the **Multi-Store Grocery Shopping Optimization Problem**, which can be formally defined as:

Given:
- A list of grocery items with required quantities
- A set of stores with their locations and item prices
- User location and travel cost preferences
- Constraints on maximum travel distance and number of stores

Find: The optimal allocation of items to stores that minimizes the total cost (item costs + weighted travel costs) while satisfying all constraints.

This is a variant of the **Multiple Knapsack Problem** combined with the **Traveling Salesman Problem**, making it NP-hard and requiring sophisticated algorithmic approaches.

### 1.3 Project Goals and Objectives

## 2. Background and Related Work

### 2.1 Related Work

**Grocery Shopping Optimization:**
- Traditional route optimization systems focus primarily on delivery logistics rather than consumer shopping patterns
- Existing grocery apps (like Honey, Basket) provide price comparison but lack comprehensive optimization
- Academic research in this domain is limited, with most work focusing on vehicle routing problems

**Dynamic Programming Applications:**
- The Multiple Knapsack Problem has been extensively studied with various DP formulations

2. **Limited Multi-Store Consideration**: Few systems optimize across multiple competing retailers
3. **Static Data Handling**: Most systems don't account for real-time price changes and availability
4. **Geographic Constraints**: Limited consideration of travel costs and user location in optimization

### 2.3 Technology Stack Justification
