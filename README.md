## üöÄ Key Features

Groczi is not just another shopping list app. It's an intelligent assistant designed to save users time and money.

### üí° The Optimization Engine

This is the core of the Groczi experience, accessible from the `comparePrices` screen. Once a user has items in their cart or a shopping list, they can initiate the optimization process.

-   **Dual Optimization Modes:**
    -   **Single-Store:** Finds the single best store for the entire list.
    -   **Multi-Store:** Calculates the most cost-effective trip by splitting the list across several nearby stores.
-   **User-Centric Preferences:** A custom `ThreeStatesSlider` component allows users to weigh their preference between **minimum cost** and **minimum travel distance**, giving them full control over the optimization algorithm's priorities.
-   **Detailed Results UI:**
    -   For single-store results, the `SingleStoreItemCard` presents the best option, clearly displaying total cost, distance, and even listing any items that are unavailable at that location.
    -   For multi-store results, each potential trip is shown as a `MultiStoreSolutionItem`. These cards are expandable, revealing a `StoreInSolutionItem` for each stop on the trip. Expanding a store then shows the exact items to purchase there, rendered by the `StoreItemInSolution` component.
-   **Seamless Navigation:** From any result, users can tap a button to get turn-by-turn directions via their device's native mapping application.

### üìã Comprehensive List Management

Groczi provides robust functionality for creating and managing shopping lists, making it a powerful tool for household organization.

-   **Full CRUD Functionality:** Users can Create, Read, Update, and Delete any number of lists from the `my-lists` tab.
-   **Intuitive Edit Mode:** A dedicated "Edit Mode" allows for the bulk selection and deletion of multiple lists, streamlined for efficiency.
-   **Price Awareness:** Each list item (`ListItem`) displays an estimated minimum price for the entire list, giving users a budget forecast at a glance.
-   **Dedicated List View:** Tapping a list navigates to the `listInfo` screen, which displays all items in that specific list using the reusable `CartItem` component. From here, users can adjust quantities or send the entire list directly to the Price Comparison engine.

### üîç Advanced Product Discovery

Finding items is fast, intuitive, and versatile.

-   **Autocomplete Search:** The home screen features a `GroceryAutoCompleteInput` that provides instant search suggestions by calling the groceries API on a debounced timer as the user types.
-   **Barcode Scanning:** The `barcodeScanner` screen uses `expo-camera` to provide a fast and reliable way to look up products. Simply scan a barcode, and the app navigates directly to the `groceryInfo` screen for that item.
-   **Category Browsing:** The home screen displays a horizontal `CategoryList` for browsing items by their department (e.g., "Dairy & Eggs," "Fruits & Vegetables").
-   **Advanced Filtering:** The `FilterModal` component allows for powerful multi-faceted filtering. Users can select multiple categories to refine their search, and the results are displayed on the `groceryResults` screen.

### ‚ú® Personalization

Groczi adapts to the user's habits and location.

-   **My Groceries (Bookmarks):** Users can bookmark any item. These saved products appear in the `my-groceries` tab, rendered as `GrocerySavedCard`s. This creates a personalized catalog of frequently bought items, which can be quickly re-added to the cart or removed with a simple swipe gesture via the `SwipeDeleteItem` component.
-   **Location-Aware Promotions:** The home screen uses the device's location to fetch and display relevant promotions from nearby stores in `PromotionCard` components. Tapping a promotion shows all included products; tapping "Show More" opens a `PromotionListModal` with all deals from that store.

## üèõÔ∏è Architectural Deep Dive

### Core Philosophy

The application is built on principles of **modularity, scalability, and separation of concerns**.

1.  **Feature-First Organization:** Code is grouped by feature (e.g., `components/promotions`, `utils/api/promotions.ts`, `usePromotionsSummaryStore`). This makes the codebase easy to navigate and maintain.
2.  **Centralized State:** All application state is managed by Zustand, completely decoupling state logic from the UI. Components are "dumb" consumers of state and dispatchers of actions.
3.  **Component Reusability:** The UI is composed of small, reusable components with well-defined props. This promotes consistency and accelerates development.
4.  **Abstraction of Services:** All external interactions (like API calls) are abstracted into a dedicated service layer (`utils/api`), ensuring that components and stores are not directly concerned with the implementation details of data fetching.

### üìÅ Project Structure Analysis

Here is a detailed breakdown of the project's directory structure:

| Path | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **`app/`** | **Navigation & Screens.** Contains all application routes, managed by Expo Router. |
| `app/(root)/` | The main navigation group, defining the primary `Stack.Navigator`. |
| `app/(root)/(tabs)/` | Defines the four primary tabs of the app (`index`, `cart`, `my-groceries`, `my-lists`). |
| `app/_layout.tsx` | The root layout. Initializes fonts, the splash screen, and global providers like `PaperProvider`. |
| `app/+not-found.tsx` | A catch-all route for unmatched URLs. |
| **`assets/`** | **Static Assets.** Contains all fonts, icons, and images used in the application. |
| **`components/`** | **Reusable UI Components.** This is the heart of the UI library. |
| `components/comparePrices/` | All components specific to the complex price comparison and results screen. |
| `components/filter/` | Contains the `FilterModal` used for advanced product searching. |
| `components/grocery/` | Components for displaying grocery items in various contexts (results, saved cards, etc.). |
| `components/header/` | Reusable headers, like the generic `AppHeader` and the specialized `LocationHeader`. |
| `components/lists/` | Components for the "My Lists" feature, including items, headers, and modals. |
| `components/promotions/` | Components for displaying store promotions on cards and in modals. |
| `components/ui/` | **Base UI Kit.** General-purpose elements like modals, settings rows, and the extensive shimmer loading placeholder library. |
| **`constants/`** | **Global Constants.** Holds static, app-wide values like the `Colors.ts` palette. |
| **`hooks/`** | **Custom React Hooks.** E.g., `useColorScheme` for theme detection. |
| **`store/`** | **Zustand State Management.** A single `index.ts` file defines all state stores for the entire app. |
| **`types/`** | **TypeScript Definitions.** A global `types.d.ts` file for all custom types. |
| **`utils/`** | **Utility Functions & Services.** |
| `utils/api/` | **API Layer.** Contains all functions that fetch data from the backend. Each file corresponds to a backend resource (e.g., `cart.ts`, `lists.ts`). |
| `utils/mappers/` | Data transformation functions, e.g., mapping raw API responses to client-side types. |
| `tailwind.config.js` | Configuration file for NativeWind, allowing for custom utility classes and theme extensions. |

### üß† State Management with Zustand

We use a single, monolithic `store/index.ts` file to define all our Zustand stores. This provides a single source of truth for the entire application's state and makes it easy to understand data flow.

| Store | State Properties | Key Actions | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`useLocationStore`** | `userLatitude`, `userLongitude`, `destinationLatitude`, etc. | `setUserLocation`, `setDestinationLocation` | Tracks the user's location and any selected map destination. |
| **`useCartStore`** | `cartItems`, `isLoading` | `loadCart`, `addToCart`, `removeFromCart`, `incrementQuantity` | Manages all aspects of the user's shopping cart. |
| **`useBookmarkStore`** | `bookmarks`, `isLoading` | `loadBookmarks`, `addToBookmarks`, `removeFromBookmarks` | Manages the user's list of saved/"favorite" items. |
| **`useListStore`** | `lists`, `isLoading` | `fetchAllLists`, `addNewList`, `removeLists` | Manages the collection of user-created shopping lists. |
| **`useListDetailsStore`** | `id`, `name`, `items` | `fetchList`, `addItem`, `updateItemQuantity` | Manages the state of a *single*, currently viewed shopping list. |
| **`useGroceryStore`** | `groceriesResults`, `currentItem`, `itemStores` | `search`, `fetchItemDetail`, `fetchItemStores` | Handles fetching, searching, and displaying individual grocery products. |
| **`usePromotionsSummaryStore`** | `promotions`, `isLoading` | `fetchPromotionsGroupedByStore` | Fetches and stores the promotion data displayed on the home screen. |
| **`useCategoryStore`** | `categories`, `isLoading` | `fetchCategories` | Fetches and stores the list of all available product categories. |
| **`useSettingsStore`** | `maxStoreDistance`, `maxTravelDistance`, `maxStores` | `setMaxStoreDistance`, etc. | Persists the user's preferences for the optimization engine. |
| **`useOptimizationStore`** | `groceries`, `singleStoreResult`, `multiStoreResult` | `runSingleStoreOptimization`, `runMultiStoreOptimization` | The most complex store; it holds the input for the optimization engine and stores its results. |

### üß≠ Navigation with Expo Router

Navigation is handled declaratively using **Expo Router v3**.

-   **File-Based Routing:** Every screen is a file in the `app/` directory. This makes the navigation structure intuitive and easy to follow.
-   **Layouts:** The `_layout.tsx` files define the navigation hierarchy. The root layout sets up global providers, and nested layouts configure navigators like `Stack` and `Tabs`.
-   **Grouped Routes:** We use directory groups like `(root)` and `(tabs)` to organize routes and share layouts without affecting the URL structure.
-   **Hiding Tabs:** Screens that are part of a stack but should not appear in the tab bar (e.g., `listInfo`, `location`) are configured with `href: null` in their options. This is a clean way to handle nested navigation within a tab group.
-   **Typed Routes:** We leverage Expo Router's features for type-safe navigation, ensuring that `router.push` calls are checked against existing routes and their required parameters.

### üé® Component-Driven UI Development

The UI is built from the ground up with a library of custom, reusable components.

-   **Atomic Design Principles:** The `components/` directory is organized logically, with foundational elements in `components/ui` and more complex, feature-specific components in their respective folders.
-   **Shimmer Placeholders:** To create a perception of speed and to avoid jarring loading spinners, the app makes extensive use of shimmer placeholders. A `ShimmerContainer` component is used to easily generate lists of shimmer items, and there is a dedicated shimmer component for almost every major UI card (e.g., `GroceryResultCardShimmer`, `CartItemShimmer`, `ListItemShimmer`).
-   **Platform-Specific Polish:** We pay close attention to platform conventions.
    -   `IconSymbol.tsx` uses the `.ios.tsx` extension to render native **SF Symbols** on iOS for a perfect system look, while gracefully falling back to **Material Icons** on Android.
    -   `TabBarBackground.ios.tsx` uses `expo-blur` to create a translucent, blurred tab bar that matches the native iOS aesthetic, while other platforms get a standard opaque background.
-   **Complex Custom Components:**
    -   `SwipeDeleteItem`: A reusable wrapper for `react-native-swipe-list-view` that provides a consistent "swipe-to-delete" interaction across the app.
    -   `FloatingEyeMenu`: A complex, animated Floating Action Button built with `react-native-reanimated` that provides a delightful user interaction on the `groceryInfo` screen.
    -   `GoogleTextInput` & `GroceryAutoCompleteInput`: Powerful, reusable input components that abstract away the complexity of integrating with Google Places and the backend search API.
