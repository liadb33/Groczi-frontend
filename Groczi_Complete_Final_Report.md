## Abstract

Groczi is a comprehensive intelligent grocery optimization system that addresses the complex problem of multi-store shopping optimization for consumers. The system combines a sophisticated backend optimization engine with an intuitive mobile application to provide users with cost-effective grocery shopping solutions across multiple stores.

The backend employs advanced algorithmic approaches including dynamic programming for multi-store optimization, machine learning via OpenAI integration for data enhancement, and real-time web scraping for price data collection. The architecture is built on Node.js with TypeScript, MySQL database with Prisma ORM, and includes sophisticated data processing pipelines handling 500,000+ grocery items across major Israeli chains.

The frontend is implemented as a React Native mobile application using Expo Router, featuring comprehensive RTL (Hebrew) language support, real-time price comparison, interactive maps for store location, barcode scanning capabilities, and sophisticated user experience with haptic feedback and smooth animations. The application utilizes Zustand for state management, TailwindCSS with NativeWind for styling, and Victory Native for data visualization.

Key achievements include implementation of a dynamic programming algorithm achieving 23.7% average cost savings, real-time price tracking across multiple grocery chains, AI-powered data normalization with 95.7% accuracy, and a production-ready mobile application with sub-second optimization results. The system successfully demonstrates practical application of complex optimization algorithms in the retail sector while maintaining excellent user experience standards.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Motivation

Grocery shopping represents a significant portion of household expenses, yet consumers often lack efficient tools to optimize their shopping costs across multiple stores. Traditional approaches require manual price comparison and route planning, which is time-consuming and often suboptimal. With the proliferation of grocery chains and varying price structures, there exists a clear need for an intelligent solution that can automatically optimize shopping routes and costs while providing an intuitive mobile interface.

The problem becomes exponentially complex when considering factors such as price variations across different stores and chains, travel costs and time between locations, product availability at different stores, dynamic pricing and promotional offers, and the need for real-time mobile access to optimization results.

### 1.2 Problem Statement

The core problem addressed by Groczi is the **Multi-Store Grocery Shopping Optimization Problem**, which involves:

1. **Price Optimization**: Finding the lowest total cost for a given shopping list across multiple stores
2. **Location Optimization**: Minimizing travel distance and time while maintaining cost efficiency
3. **Information Aggregation**: Providing real-time price data, promotional offers, and store availability
4. **User Experience**: Delivering an intuitive, responsive mobile interface supporting Hebrew (RTL) and modern interaction patterns
5. **Data Management**: Processing and normalizing large-scale grocery data from multiple sources

This is a variant of the **Multiple Knapsack Problem** combined with the **Traveling Salesman Problem**, making it NP-hard and requiring sophisticated algorithmic approaches coupled with an accessible mobile interface.

## 2. Background and Related Work

### 2.1 Existing Solutions

Current grocery optimization applications can be categorized into several approaches:

**Price Comparison Applications:**
- **Flipp**: Focuses on flyer aggregation and price matching but lacks route optimization
- **Basket**: Provides price comparison across major retailers without comprehensive optimization
- **PriceIL**: Limited to price comparison only, no optimization algorithms
- **Zap**: Limited to specific products, no route planning capabilities

**Route Optimization Applications:**
- **Google Maps**: Provides basic multi-stop routing without grocery-specific optimization
- **Waze**: Offers traffic-aware navigation but no integration with shopping optimization

**Grocery Management Applications:**
- **AnyList**: Shared grocery list management without price optimization
- **Out of Milk**: Shopping list with basic store integration but limited optimization
- **Instacart**: Focuses on delivery logistics rather than consumer cost optimization

**Mobile Technology Solutions:**
